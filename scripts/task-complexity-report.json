      "taskTitle": "Setup Project Structure and Dependencies",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the project setup task into specific subtasks covering repository creation, folder structure setup, dependency installation, environment configuration, and documentation. For each subtask, specify exact tools, libraries, and configuration approaches.",
      "reasoning": "This is a foundational task with moderate complexity. It involves standard project setup activities but requires careful planning of the architecture. The task is well-defined with clear deliverables and no external dependencies."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Core Web Scraping Framework",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the web scraping framework implementation into subtasks covering base scraper class design, site-specific extension mechanisms, request handling (including pagination, authentication, rate limiting), proxy rotation implementation, error handling systems, and data extraction/normalization components.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to the need for a flexible, robust framework that handles various websites. It requires addressing technical challenges like rate limiting, proxy rotation, and error handling, while ensuring extensibility for different site structures."

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Social Media API Connectors",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the social media connector development into platform-specific subtasks (Twitter, Reddit, StockTwits, etc.), plus a common interface design task. For each platform, detail authentication methods, rate limit handling, data extraction approaches, and standardization requirements.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves moderate to high complexity due to the need to work with multiple external APIs, each with different authentication methods, rate limits, and data structures. Creating a unified interface adds additional complexity."
    },

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Build Data Storage and Caching System",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the storage system implementation into subtasks covering database schema design, database implementation, caching layer development, data expiration policy implementation, and performance optimization. Include specific considerations for different data types and access patterns.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to the need to design an efficient database schema that accommodates diverse data types while implementing a sophisticated caching system with expiration policies. Performance considerations add significant complexity."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Financial Data Extraction Modules",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the financial data extraction into subtasks for different data types (stock prices, company financials, analyst ratings, market indicators) and source-specific implementations. Include subtasks for parser development, data normalization, validation, and testing with real financial data sources.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to the specialized nature of financial data, the variety of sources and formats, and the critical importance of accuracy. Normalization across different sources and handling structured financial formats adds significant complexity."
    },

      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Develop News and Analysis Content Extraction",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the news extraction task into subtasks covering source-specific scrapers, content extraction and cleaning, metadata extraction (dates, authors, categories), entity identification in articles, and source credibility assessment system development.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves high complexity due to the unstructured nature of news content, the variety of sources, and the need for sophisticated text processing. The credibility assessment component adds additional complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Sentiment Analysis and Entity Recognition",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the NLP implementation into subtasks covering financial sentiment model selection/training, entity recognition system development, sentiment aggregation mechanisms, confidence scoring implementation, sentiment shift detection, and integration with existing data sources.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to the specialized NLP requirements for financial content. Developing or fine-tuning models for financial sentiment analysis and entity recognition requires significant expertise, and the aggregation and confidence scoring add additional layers of complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Create Data Integration and Enrichment Pipeline",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the integration pipeline into subtasks covering data source connector development, entity resolution system, relationship mapping, context enrichment processes, historical data integration, conflict detection mechanisms, and pipeline orchestration.",
      "reasoning": "This is one of the most complex tasks in the project, requiring integration of diverse data sources while maintaining data integrity. Entity resolution across different sources is particularly challenging, as is conflict detection and resolution. The pipeline must handle complex relationships and enrichment processes."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Implement API for Agentic UX Integration",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the API implementation into subtasks covering API design/specification, core endpoint development for different data types, query parameter implementation (filtering, sorting, pagination), authentication/security implementation, and documentation/example creation.",
      "reasoning": "This task has moderate complexity, involving standard API development practices but requiring careful design to expose the complex underlying data effectively. Authentication, rate limiting, and comprehensive documentation add to the complexity."
