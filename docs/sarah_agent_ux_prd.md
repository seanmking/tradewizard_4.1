# TradeWizard 4.1 – PRD: Sarah Agent UX & Orchestration

## Title: **From Smart Script to Strategic Copilot – PRD for Sarah’s Agentic Evolution**

This PRD defines the roadmap for transforming Sarah from a linear, scripted assistant into a dynamic AI agent who interprets context, guides users with intelligence, adapts tone, and accelerates export readiness through proactive reasoning. It outlines UX orchestration, agent state logic, next-best-action flows, and Sarah’s integration into product classification and market preparation.

...

_Once approved, the next step is to translate this into sprint tasks for orchestration logic, prompt templating, state tracking, and adaptive UX behaviors._
