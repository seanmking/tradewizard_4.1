# Task ID: 3
# Title: Build Product Classification System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the HS code classification system to help users properly classify their products using the Harmonized System.
# Details:
Create a CSV-based HS code database with structured format for hierarchical navigation. Implement a cascading dropdown selection interface (chapter → heading → subheading). Add search functionality for codes and descriptions. Build product management interface to display products extracted from website analysis and allow manual addition/editing. Implement confidence indicators for suggestions. Ensure the system is future-proof for country-specific extensions. Note: Do not reuse any UI components from TradeWizard 3.0.

# Test Strategy:
Verify correct loading and parsing of the HS code database. Test the hierarchical navigation through code levels. Validate search functionality with various product keywords. Test manual product addition and editing. Verify proper classification and storage of selected HS codes.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create HS Code Database and Data Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the CSV-based HS code database with a structured format that supports hierarchical navigation through chapters, headings, and subheadings of the Harmonized System.
### Details:
Create a CSV file with columns for code, description, level (chapter/heading/subheading), parent code references, and metadata. Import the complete Harmonized System classification data. Implement data validation to ensure integrity of the hierarchical structure. Design the data access layer to efficiently query and filter the HS codes. Include fields for future country-specific extensions (e.g., additional digits for national use). Document the database schema and access patterns.

## 2. Implement Cascading Dropdown Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Build a user interface with cascading dropdown selections that allows users to navigate through the HS code hierarchy from chapter to heading to subheading.
### Details:
Create custom dropdown components that dynamically load options based on previous selections. Implement the three-level navigation: chapter (2-digit) → heading (4-digit) → subheading (6-digit). Display both code numbers and descriptions in the dropdowns. Ensure the UI is responsive and accessible. Add visual indicators to show the current selection path. Cache loaded data appropriately to improve performance. Include tooltips with additional information about each code when hovering.

## 3. Develop Search Functionality and Confidence Indicators [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Implement search capabilities for HS codes and descriptions, along with confidence indicators for suggested classifications.
### Details:
Build a search component that queries both code numbers and descriptions. Implement fuzzy matching and keyword relevance scoring. Display search results with highlighting of matching terms. Create a confidence scoring algorithm based on keyword matches, historical selections, and data patterns. Visualize confidence levels using color-coded indicators or percentage scores. Allow filtering of search results by confidence level. Optimize search performance for quick response times even with large datasets.

## 4. Build Product Management Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.3
### Description: Create an interface to display products extracted from website analysis and enable manual addition, editing, and classification of products.
### Details:
Design a product listing view with pagination and sorting capabilities. Implement a form for manual product entry with fields for name, description, and attributes. Create an editing interface for existing products. Integrate the classification system to allow assigning HS codes to products using the cascading dropdowns or search. Display confidence indicators for suggested classifications. Implement batch operations for classifying multiple products. Add validation to ensure all products have valid classifications before export. Include a history of classification changes for audit purposes.
