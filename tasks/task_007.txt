# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop Export Readiness Report Generation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the functionality to generate comprehensive export readiness reports with actionable insights and recommendations.
# Details:
Implement React-PDF for document generation as specified in the PRD. Create modular report templates with sections for business profile summary, product classification details, target market analysis, certification and documentation roadmap, timeline and budget recommendations, and action plan with prioritized steps. Develop both PDF and on-screen interactive versions of the report. Implement sharing functionality. Ensure print-friendly styling for all report formats.

# Test Strategy:
Test PDF generation with various assessment data. Verify all report sections contain accurate information. Test on-screen interactive version functionality. Validate sharing features. Test printing capability for generated reports. Verify performance meets the requirement of PDF generation in < 5 seconds.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up React-PDF integration and basic report structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate React-PDF library and create the foundational document structure for export readiness reports
### Details:
Install and configure React-PDF library in the project. Create a base report component with proper document structure including headers, footers, page numbering, and company branding. Implement the core layout that will accommodate all required report sections (business profile, product classification, market analysis, etc.). Set up proper styling foundations with a consistent design system that matches the application's look and feel. Create reusable PDF components for common elements like section headers, tables, and callout boxes.

## 2. Implement data aggregation and report content generation logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Develop the backend logic to collect, process, and format all necessary data for comprehensive export readiness reports
### Details:
Create data processing services to gather and organize information from various assessment areas (business profile, product classification, target markets, etc.). Implement algorithms to generate actionable insights and recommendations based on assessment data. Develop the logic for certification roadmaps and timeline generation. Create budget calculation functionality based on identified requirements. Design the prioritization system for the action plan section. Ensure all data is properly formatted for both PDF rendering and interactive display.

## 3. Build modular report templates with all required sections [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2
### Description: Create the individual report section components and templates for each required area of the export readiness report
### Details:
Develop separate components for each report section: business profile summary, product classification details, target market analysis, certification roadmap, timeline visualization, budget recommendations, and prioritized action plan. Implement data visualization elements (charts, graphs, progress indicators) for relevant sections. Create conditional rendering logic to customize section content based on assessment results. Ensure each section has appropriate styling for both PDF and on-screen display. Implement print-friendly CSS for all components.

## 4. Create interactive on-screen report version [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Develop the interactive web-based version of the export readiness report with enhanced user features
### Details:
Build a React component structure for displaying the report directly in the browser. Implement interactive elements like expandable sections, tooltips for additional information, and clickable links to relevant resources. Create navigation controls for moving between report sections. Develop responsive layouts that work across different screen sizes. Add interactive features that aren't possible in PDF format, such as dynamic filtering of recommendations or interactive timelines. Ensure the interactive version maintains visual consistency with the PDF version.

## 5. Implement report generation workflow and sharing functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3, 7.4
### Description: Create the end-to-end process for generating, downloading, and sharing export readiness reports
### Details:
Develop the user interface for initiating report generation, including any configuration options. Implement PDF download functionality with appropriate file naming conventions. Create sharing capabilities including email, direct link sharing, and social media integration if specified. Add options for users to select between full reports or specific sections only. Implement proper error handling and loading states during report generation. Add analytics tracking to monitor report usage. Test the entire workflow across different browsers and devices to ensure consistent functionality.
