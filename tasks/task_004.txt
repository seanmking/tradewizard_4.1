# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the market assessment feature to evaluate target export markets and understand market-specific requirements.
# Details:
Develop a market selection interface supporting multiple target markets (UAE, UK, USA, African countries). Create a database of country-specific requirements. Implement integration with the HS classification system to show product-specific requirements. Build interfaces to display market intelligence (market size, growth trends, competitive landscape, tariff information, trade agreement details). Develop requirement analysis features showing certification requirements, documentation needs, regulatory compliance information, and estimated timeline for market entry.

# Test Strategy:
Test market selection for all supported countries. Verify correct display of market-specific requirements based on product classification. Validate integration between HS codes and market requirements. Test the display of all required market intelligence components.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and implement market selection interface [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the UI components and database structure for market selection functionality
### Details:
Develop a user interface allowing selection of multiple target markets (UAE, UK, USA, African countries). Create database models to store market selections. Implement filtering functionality to compare markets side by side. Design should be responsive and allow for future addition of new markets. Include a favorites/bookmarks feature for frequently accessed markets.

## 2. Build country-specific requirements database [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create a comprehensive database of market-specific requirements for each target export market
### Details:
Design and implement database schemas to store country-specific requirements including regulatory standards, certification needs, and documentation requirements. Create admin interfaces for updating this information. Import initial data for the primary markets (UAE, UK, USA, major African countries). Include versioning to track requirement changes over time. Implement a tagging system to categorize requirements by type (legal, financial, logistical, etc.).

## 3. Integrate with HS classification system [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Connect the market assessment tool with the HS classification system to display product-specific requirements
### Details:
Implement API integration with the Harmonized System (HS) classification database. Create mapping between HS codes and country-specific requirements. Develop UI components to display product-specific requirements based on HS code selection. Include search functionality for HS codes. Build caching mechanisms to improve performance. Implement validation to ensure requirements displayed match the selected product category.

## 4. Develop market intelligence visualization components [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2
### Description: Create interfaces to display comprehensive market intelligence data
### Details:
Design and implement visualization components (charts, graphs, tables) to display market intelligence including market size, growth trends, competitive landscape, tariff information, and trade agreement details. Create data models to store and update this information. Implement filters to customize views based on specific metrics. Include export functionality for reports. Add comparison views to evaluate multiple markets simultaneously.

## 5. Implement requirement analysis and timeline estimation features [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.3, 4.4
### Description: Build functionality to analyze requirements and generate market entry timelines
### Details:
Develop algorithms to analyze certification requirements, documentation needs, and regulatory compliance information based on selected market and product. Create a timeline estimation engine that calculates realistic market entry timelines. Implement a dashboard showing requirement completion status. Build notification system for requirement updates. Create PDF export functionality for generated reports. Include a checklist feature for tracking progress on meeting requirements.
