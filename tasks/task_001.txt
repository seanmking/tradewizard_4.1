# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Next.js Project with TypeScript and TailwindCSS
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the Next.js 14.x project with React 18.x, TypeScript 5.x, and TailwindCSS. Set up the folder structure and basic configuration for the three-panel layout.
# Details:
Create a new Next.js project using `create-next-app` with TypeScript support. Configure TailwindCSS with the required color scheme (Primary: Purple #6B46C1, Secondary: Teal #319795, Neutrals: Gray scale #F9FAFB). Set up the basic folder structure following Next.js best practices. Create placeholder components for the three-panel layout (Left Navigation Panel, Center Conversation Panel, Right Context Panel). Configure React Context API for state management. Set up Vercel deployment and GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

# Test Strategy:
Verify successful project initialization. Test the base application for proper rendering. Ensure TailwindCSS is correctly configured with the specified color scheme. Validate responsive behavior of the three-panel layout.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a new Next.js 14.x project with TypeScript 5.x support using create-next-app and set up the basic folder structure
### Details:
Run `npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript` to create the project. Verify TypeScript configuration in tsconfig.json and adjust if needed. Create the following folder structure: /components for UI components, /contexts for React Context files, /hooks for custom hooks, /lib for utility functions, /pages or /app (depending on chosen router). Add README.md with project setup instructions.

## 2. Configure TailwindCSS with custom theme [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Install and configure TailwindCSS with the required color scheme and basic styling utilities
### Details:
Install TailwindCSS with `npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer`, then initialize with `npx tailwindcss init -p`. Configure the content paths in tailwind.config.js. Add the required color scheme to the theme section: Primary: Purple #6B46C1, Secondary: Teal #319795, Neutrals: Gray scale #F9FAFB. Create a globals.css file with @tailwind directives and import it in _app.tsx or layout.tsx.

## 3. Create placeholder components for three-panel layout [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Implement the basic structure for the three-panel layout with responsive design considerations
### Details:
Create the following components: 1) LeftPanel.tsx for navigation with a fixed width (280px on desktop, full-width slide-in on mobile), 2) CenterPanel.tsx for the main conversation area (flexible width), 3) RightPanel.tsx for the context panel (320px on desktop, hideable on smaller screens), 4) Layout.tsx to compose the three panels. Use Flexbox or Grid for layout. Add basic responsive behavior with Tailwind's responsive modifiers (sm:, md:, lg:).

## 4. Set up React Context API for state management [done]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Create context providers for managing application state across components
### Details:
Create a contexts folder with: 1) AppContext.tsx for global app state (theme, user preferences), 2) UIContext.tsx for UI state (panel visibility, responsive layout state), 3) Create custom hooks (useApp.ts, useUI.ts) to access these contexts. Implement the context providers in _app.tsx or layout.tsx to wrap the application. Add TypeScript interfaces for all state types and context values.

## 5. Configure CI/CD with GitHub Actions and Vercel [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4
### Description: Set up the deployment pipeline with GitHub Actions for testing and Vercel for deployment
### Details:
Initialize Git repository if not done already. Create .github/workflows/ci.yml for GitHub Actions with jobs for linting and type-checking. Set up Vercel CLI with `npm i -g vercel` and link to Vercel account. Configure vercel.json with project settings. Add deployment scripts to package.json. Create .env.example for environment variables. Document the deployment process in README.md with instructions for both development and production environments.

## 6. Implement landing page and user onboarding form [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.4
### Description: Create an attractive landing page and user onboarding form to collect initial user information
### Details:
Design and implement an engaging landing page that introduces the application's purpose and benefits. Create a multi-step onboarding form to collect essential user information (business name, industry, contact details, export goals). Implement form validation with helpful error messages. Store onboarding data in the application state using the Context API. Add progress indicators for multi-step forms. Ensure the landing page and onboarding process are fully responsive and accessible. Include clear call-to-action buttons to guide users to the next steps.
