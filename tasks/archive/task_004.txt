# Task ID: 4
# Title: Build Data Storage and Caching System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a storage solution for scraped data with caching mechanisms to optimize performance and reduce redundant requests.
# Details:
Design and implement a database schema for storing scraped financial data, news articles, and social media posts. Include metadata such as source, timestamp, and relevance scores. Develop a caching layer that stores frequently accessed data and recent queries to reduce API calls and web scraping operations. Implement data expiration policies based on the type of information (e.g., real-time market data vs. historical articles).

# Test Strategy:
Test the storage system with sample data to verify proper insertion, retrieval, and updating. Measure query performance and validate that the caching mechanism reduces duplicate requests. Verify data expiration works correctly by manipulating timestamps.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Database Schema for Financial Data Storage [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive database schema to store different types of financial data including market data, news articles, and social media posts.
### Details:
Design tables for: (1) Market data with fields for ticker symbols, prices, volumes, timestamps; (2) News articles with fields for title, content, source, publication date, relevance score; (3) Social media posts with fields for platform, author, content, timestamp, sentiment score; (4) Common metadata tables for sources, categories, and tags. Include proper indexing strategies for efficient querying. Document the schema with an ER diagram and field descriptions. Consider using a relational database (PostgreSQL) for structured data with JSON fields for flexible attributes.

## 2. Implement Database Access Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Develop a data access layer that provides CRUD operations for all data types in the schema.
### Details:
Create a modular data access layer with: (1) Connection pooling to optimize database connections; (2) Repository classes for each data entity type; (3) Query builders with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection; (4) Transaction management for operations requiring atomicity; (5) Error handling and logging for database operations; (6) Serialization/deserialization utilities to convert between database records and application objects. Use an ORM framework if appropriate, but ensure custom queries are available for performance-critical operations.

## 3. Develop In-Memory Caching System [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Implement an in-memory caching mechanism to store frequently accessed data and reduce database load.
### Details:
Build a caching system with: (1) LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policy; (2) Time-based expiration for different data types (e.g., 1 minute for real-time market data, 1 hour for news, 1 day for historical data); (3) Cache key generation strategy based on query parameters; (4) Thread-safe implementation for concurrent access; (5) Memory usage monitoring and limits; (6) Statistics tracking for cache hits/misses. Consider using Redis or a similar in-memory data store, or implement a custom solution using a concurrent hash map with expiration handling.

## 4. Implement Query Result Caching and Deduplication [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Create a system to cache query results and implement deduplication logic to prevent redundant scraping operations.
### Details:
Develop a query result cache that: (1) Stores complete result sets for common queries; (2) Implements content-based deduplication to identify similar articles or posts; (3) Uses bloom filters to quickly check if content likely exists before performing expensive comparison operations; (4) Maintains a request history to prevent repeated scraping of the same sources within configurable time windows; (5) Provides cache invalidation hooks when new data is added; (6) Implements different caching strategies based on query type and data freshness requirements. Include metrics to measure cache efficiency and adjust parameters accordingly.

## 5. Create Data Expiration and Archiving System [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.3, 4.4
### Description: Implement policies for data expiration, archiving, and pruning to manage database growth and maintain performance.
### Details:
Build a data lifecycle management system that: (1) Defines retention policies for different data types (e.g., keep real-time market data for 7 days, news for 90 days, social media posts for 30 days); (2) Implements a background job to move expired data to archive storage; (3) Compresses archived data to reduce storage requirements; (4) Maintains summary statistics and aggregated data even after raw data is archived; (5) Provides an API to access archived data when needed; (6) Includes monitoring and alerts for database size and growth rate. Use partitioning strategies for large tables to improve query performance and facilitate easier archiving of older partitions.
