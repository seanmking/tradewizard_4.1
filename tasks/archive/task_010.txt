# Task ID: 10
# Title: Build Monitoring and Maintenance System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 5, 6, 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement monitoring tools to track the health of scrapers, detect changes in website structures, and maintain data quality.
# Details:
Develop a monitoring system that tracks the success rate of scraping operations and API calls. Implement alerts for failures or anomalies in the data. Create tools to detect when website structures change and scrapers need updating. Build a dashboard for visualizing system health and data quality metrics. Implement automated tests that periodically validate the entire pipeline.

# Test Strategy:
Test the monitoring system by intentionally introducing failures and verifying alerts are triggered. Validate that the system can detect structural changes in sample websites. Verify that the dashboard accurately reflects the current state of the system and data quality metrics.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Scraper Health Tracking System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a system to track and log the success/failure rate of all scraping operations and API calls
### Details:
Develop a centralized logging system that captures key metrics for each scraper run: success/failure status, execution time, error messages, and data volume collected. Implement a database schema to store these metrics with appropriate timestamps and scraper identifiers. Add instrumentation code to all existing scrapers to report these metrics. Include retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for transient failures. Ensure the system can handle both scheduled and on-demand scraping jobs.

## 2. Develop Website Structure Change Detection [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create a mechanism to detect when target website structures change, potentially breaking scrapers
### Details:
Implement checksums or fingerprinting of key webpage elements that scrapers depend on. Store these fingerprints as baselines. During each scrape, compare current fingerprints against baselines to detect structural changes. Use DOM tree comparison algorithms to identify specific changes in the HTML structure. Create a classification system for changes (minor/major/critical). Develop a reporting mechanism that provides detailed information about detected changes, including before/after comparisons and specific HTML elements affected.

## 3. Build Alert and Notification System [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2
### Description: Implement a system to alert stakeholders about scraper failures, data anomalies, and website structure changes
### Details:
Create configurable alert thresholds for different types of events (failure rates, response times, data volume changes, structure changes). Implement multiple notification channels (email, Slack, SMS) with appropriate severity levels. Design an alert aggregation system to prevent notification storms during widespread issues. Include actionable information in alerts with links to relevant dashboards or logs. Implement an acknowledgment system for alerts to track response status. Create escalation paths for critical unacknowledged alerts.

## 4. Implement Data Quality Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Develop tools to monitor and validate the quality of scraped data
### Details:
Define key data quality metrics (completeness, consistency, accuracy, timeliness). Implement statistical analysis to detect anomalies in data distributions and volumes. Create validation rules for different data types and sources. Build a system to track data quality metrics over time and detect degradation. Implement automated data sampling for manual review when quality thresholds are breached. Develop mechanisms to flag or quarantine potentially problematic data for review before it enters production systems.

## 5. Create Monitoring Dashboard [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4
### Description: Build a visual dashboard to display system health, scraper performance, and data quality metrics
### Details:
Design an intuitive UI with real-time and historical views of all monitoring metrics. Implement interactive charts and graphs for key performance indicators. Create drill-down capabilities to investigate specific issues. Include status indicators for all system components and scrapers. Develop customizable views for different user roles (developers, data analysts, managers). Implement filtering and search capabilities to locate specific scrapers or data sources. Ensure the dashboard is responsive and works on mobile devices for on-call support.

## 6. Develop Automated Testing and Validation Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.4
### Description: Implement end-to-end automated tests that periodically validate the entire scraping pipeline
### Details:
Create a suite of automated tests that run on a schedule to validate the entire scraping pipeline. Implement synthetic test cases that exercise all scrapers with known good inputs and expected outputs. Develop integration tests that verify data flows correctly through all system components. Create regression tests to ensure that fixed issues don't recur. Implement canary tests that run before deploying scraper updates to detect potential issues. Build a reporting system that documents test results and trends over time. Ensure tests can run in isolated environments to prevent impact on production data.
