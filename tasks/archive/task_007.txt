# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Sentiment Analysis and Entity Recognition
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop NLP components to analyze sentiment in financial content and recognize relevant entities.
# Details:
Integrate or develop NLP models for sentiment analysis specifically calibrated for financial content. Implement named entity recognition to identify companies, financial instruments, and market events in text. Create a system to aggregate sentiment scores across multiple sources and calculate confidence levels. Develop methods to detect significant sentiment shifts that might indicate market movements.

# Test Strategy:
Test sentiment analysis against a labeled dataset of financial content with known sentiment. Evaluate entity recognition accuracy using precision and recall metrics. Verify the aggregation system correctly weights different sources based on their credibility and relevance.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Research and Select NLP Models for Financial Sentiment Analysis [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Research, evaluate, and select appropriate NLP models that can be fine-tuned for financial sentiment analysis
### Details:
Conduct research on existing NLP models suitable for sentiment analysis in financial contexts (BERT, FinBERT, RoBERTa, etc.). Compare performance metrics, resource requirements, and adaptability. Create a comparison matrix of at least 3 candidate models with their pros and cons. Select the most appropriate model based on accuracy, processing speed, and implementation complexity. Document the selection rationale and prepare the environment for the chosen model.

## 2. Implement and Fine-tune Financial Sentiment Analysis Model [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Implement the selected sentiment analysis model and fine-tune it specifically for financial content
### Details:
Set up the selected model from subtask 1. Collect and prepare a labeled dataset of financial texts with sentiment annotations (positive, negative, neutral). Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. Fine-tune the model using the training data with appropriate hyperparameters. Evaluate performance on the validation set and iterate to improve accuracy. Document the fine-tuning process, hyperparameters, and final performance metrics. Create an API endpoint that accepts text input and returns sentiment scores.

## 3. Develop Named Entity Recognition for Financial Entities [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Implement named entity recognition to identify companies, financial instruments, and market events in text
### Details:
Research and select an appropriate NER model or framework (SpaCy, NLTK, custom model). Create or obtain a labeled dataset for financial entities including companies, people, financial instruments, currencies, and market events. Train or fine-tune the NER model on the financial dataset. Implement post-processing rules to improve entity recognition accuracy for financial-specific terms. Create functions to extract and categorize identified entities. Develop an API endpoint that processes text and returns structured entity data. Test with diverse financial texts and measure precision and recall.

## 4. Create Sentiment Aggregation System [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Develop a system to aggregate sentiment scores across multiple sources with confidence levels
### Details:
Design a database schema to store sentiment analysis results from multiple sources. Implement weighted aggregation algorithms that consider source reliability, recency, and relevance. Develop statistical methods to calculate confidence levels based on consistency across sources, sample size, and model certainty. Create visualization components to display aggregated sentiment trends over time. Implement filters to segment sentiment by entity, source type, or time period. Build an API that returns aggregated sentiment data with confidence metrics. Document the aggregation methodology and confidence calculation approach.

## 5. Implement Sentiment Shift Detection [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.4
### Description: Develop methods to detect significant sentiment shifts that might indicate market movements
### Details:
Design algorithms to identify statistically significant changes in sentiment over various time windows (hourly, daily, weekly). Implement anomaly detection to identify unusual sentiment patterns. Create threshold-based alerts for rapid sentiment shifts. Develop correlation analysis between historical sentiment shifts and market movements to calibrate detection sensitivity. Build a notification system for detected shifts that includes the magnitude, affected entities, and confidence level. Create a dashboard to visualize detected sentiment shifts. Implement an API endpoint for querying historical and real-time sentiment shift data.

## 6. Integrate and Optimize the Complete NLP Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3, 7.5
### Description: Integrate sentiment analysis, entity recognition, aggregation, and shift detection into a cohesive pipeline and optimize performance
### Details:
Design and implement a unified API that combines all NLP components. Create an efficient processing pipeline that handles text input through sentiment analysis, entity recognition, aggregation, and shift detection. Implement caching mechanisms to avoid redundant processing. Optimize the pipeline for performance, focusing on processing speed and resource utilization. Develop comprehensive logging and monitoring. Create documentation for the entire system including API specifications, component interactions, and usage examples. Conduct end-to-end testing with real-world financial content. Implement batch processing capabilities for analyzing large volumes of historical data.
