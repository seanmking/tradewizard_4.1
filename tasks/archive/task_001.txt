# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Structure and Dependencies
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the TradeWizard 4.1 web scraping project structure with necessary dependencies for web and social data extraction.
# Details:
Create a new project repository for the TradeWizard 4.1 web scraping component. Set up the basic folder structure including directories for scrapers, processors, storage, and API interfaces. Install required dependencies for web scraping (e.g., BeautifulSoup, Selenium, Scrapy), social media API access, and data processing libraries. Configure environment variables for API keys and credentials.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all dependencies install correctly and the project structure follows best practices. Create a simple test script that imports all major dependencies to confirm they're working properly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Repository and Define Folder Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize the TradeWizard 4.1 repository and establish the core directory structure for the web scraping component.
### Details:
Create a new Git repository named 'tradewizard-4.1-scraper'. Set up the following directory structure: /scrapers (with subdirectories for different data sources), /processors (for data transformation logic), /storage (for database connectors and caching), /api (for external API interfaces), /tests (for unit and integration tests), and /config (for configuration files). Include a README.md with project overview and setup instructions.

## 2. Install Core Web Scraping Dependencies [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up the Python environment and install primary web scraping libraries needed for the project.
### Details:
Create a virtual environment using venv or conda. Install and configure the following core dependencies: BeautifulSoup4 for HTML parsing, Selenium with appropriate webdrivers for dynamic content, Scrapy for structured crawling, Requests for HTTP operations, and lxml for XML/HTML processing. Create a requirements.txt file documenting all dependencies with specific versions. Include a setup.py file for package installation.

## 3. Implement Social Media API Connectors [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Set up the necessary libraries and authentication for accessing social media platforms' APIs.
### Details:
Install Python libraries for major social media platforms: tweepy for Twitter, facebook-sdk for Facebook, praw for Reddit, and python-linkedin for LinkedIn. Create connector classes in the /api directory that handle authentication and basic data retrieval for each platform. Implement proper error handling and rate limit management in each connector. Document the required API credentials for each platform.

## 4. Configure Environment and Credentials Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Establish a secure system for managing API keys, credentials, and environment-specific configurations.
### Details:
Create a .env.example file listing all required environment variables without actual values. Implement a configuration module using python-dotenv to load variables from .env files. Set up different configuration profiles for development, testing, and production environments. Add appropriate entries to .gitignore to prevent credentials from being committed. Create a documentation file explaining how to obtain and configure the necessary API keys for each service.

## 5. Set Up Data Processing and Storage Libraries [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.4
### Description: Install and configure libraries for data processing, transformation, and storage of scraped information.
### Details:
Install pandas and numpy for data manipulation, SQLAlchemy for database ORM, pymongo for NoSQL storage options, and redis for caching. Create base classes in the /storage directory for different storage backends. Implement data models and schemas for structured storage of scraped data. Set up configuration for connecting to development databases locally. Include basic data validation utilities and transformation helpers in the /processors directory.
