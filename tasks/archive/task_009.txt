# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement API for Agentic UX Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop an API that allows the TradeWizard agentic UX to access the extracted and enriched data.
# Details:
Design and implement a RESTful API that provides access to the scraped and processed data. Create endpoints for querying financial data, news, social sentiment, and integrated insights. Implement filtering, sorting, and pagination capabilities. Develop authentication and rate limiting for API access. Create detailed API documentation with examples for the UX team.

# Test Strategy:
Develop comprehensive API tests that verify all endpoints return the expected data in the correct format. Test authentication, rate limiting, and error handling. Create integration tests that simulate how the agentic UX will interact with the API.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design API architecture and data models [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the overall API architecture, define data models, and plan the endpoint structure for the TradeWizard API.
### Details:
Design a RESTful API architecture that exposes the extracted financial data, news, social sentiment, and integrated insights. Define JSON schemas for all response objects. Create an endpoint map documenting all planned routes (GET /api/v1/financial-data, GET /api/v1/news, etc.). Determine query parameter standards for filtering, sorting, and pagination. Document the relationships between different data types and how they'll be exposed through the API. Create OpenAPI/Swagger specification drafts.

## 2. Implement core data access endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Develop the primary API endpoints that provide access to the fundamental data types: financial data, news, and social sentiment.
### Details:
Implement RESTful endpoints for accessing financial data (GET /api/v1/financial-data), news (GET /api/v1/news), and social sentiment (GET /api/v1/sentiment). Each endpoint should include filtering capabilities via query parameters (e.g., date ranges, symbols, keywords). Implement sorting functionality (e.g., ?sort=date:desc). Add pagination using limit/offset or cursor-based approaches with appropriate metadata in responses. Ensure proper error handling with descriptive error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes.

## 3. Implement advanced query and integrated insights endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Develop endpoints that provide access to integrated insights and allow for more complex queries across multiple data types.
### Details:
Create endpoints for accessing integrated insights that combine multiple data sources (GET /api/v1/insights). Implement advanced query capabilities that allow the UX to request correlated data across financial metrics, news, and sentiment (e.g., GET /api/v1/correlated-data?metric=price&news=true). Add specialized endpoints for common UX needs like trend analysis (GET /api/v1/trends) and anomaly detection (GET /api/v1/anomalies). Ensure these endpoints maintain the same filtering, sorting, and pagination standards established in the core endpoints.

## 4. Implement authentication and rate limiting [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.3
### Description: Add security layers to the API including authentication, authorization, and rate limiting to protect the API from abuse.
### Details:
Implement JWT-based authentication for API access. Create user registration and token issuance endpoints. Add middleware for validating authentication tokens on protected routes. Implement role-based access control for different API capabilities. Add rate limiting using a token bucket or similar algorithm to prevent abuse (e.g., X requests per minute per user). Implement request logging for security auditing. Add appropriate security headers (CORS, Content-Security-Policy, etc.) to API responses.

## 5. Create comprehensive API documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.3, 9.4
### Description: Develop detailed API documentation with examples to help the UX team integrate with the API effectively.
### Details:
Generate interactive API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger. Include detailed descriptions for all endpoints, parameters, and response objects. Create example requests and responses for common use cases. Document authentication flows with step-by-step instructions. Add code samples in relevant languages (JavaScript/TypeScript) that the UX team will use. Create a getting started guide with examples of how to fetch and display different types of data. Document rate limiting policies and best practices for efficient API usage. Set up a documentation website or integrate with an existing developer portal.
