# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Financial Data Extraction Modules
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create specialized scrapers for financial data sources including stock prices, company financials, and market indicators.
# Details:
Develop specific scraper implementations for major financial websites and data providers. Extract stock prices, company financial statements, analyst ratings, and market indicators. Implement parsers for structured financial data formats (CSV, JSON, XML). Create normalization functions to standardize data from different sources into a consistent format for the TradeWizard platform.

# Test Strategy:
Test each financial data extractor against its target source. Verify the accuracy of extracted numerical data by comparing with known values. Validate that all required financial metrics are being captured correctly and normalized to the expected format.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Core Financial Scraper Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the base architecture for financial data scrapers with common functionality and interfaces
### Details:
Implement a core scraper class with configurable request handling, rate limiting, and error management. Define interfaces for different financial data types (stock prices, financial statements, market indicators). Create abstract base classes that implement common functionality like authentication, session management, and HTTP request patterns. Design a plugin system to allow easy addition of new data sources.

## 2. Implement Stock Price Data Extractors [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Build scrapers for real-time and historical stock price data from major providers
### Details:
Develop concrete implementations for extracting stock price data from at least 3 major sources (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud). Implement functionality to retrieve both real-time quotes and historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data with configurable time intervals. Add support for handling stock splits and dividends. Include methods for batch retrieval of multiple symbols. Implement appropriate error handling for rate limits and service disruptions.

## 3. Implement Company Financial Statement Extractors [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create scrapers for company financial statements and fundamental data
### Details:
Develop extractors for quarterly and annual financial statements (income statements, balance sheets, cash flow statements) from SEC filings and financial data providers. Implement functionality to retrieve key financial ratios and metrics. Create parsers for XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) data from regulatory filings. Add support for retrieving company metadata (sector, industry, market cap). Include historical data retrieval with appropriate versioning.

## 4. Implement Market Indicators and Analyst Data Extractors [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Build scrapers for market-wide indicators and analyst recommendations
### Details:
Develop extractors for market indicators (indices, sector performance, volatility measures, economic indicators). Implement functionality to retrieve analyst ratings, price targets, and consensus estimates. Create scrapers for sentiment data and news sentiment analysis. Add support for macroeconomic data points that impact markets. Implement appropriate caching mechanisms for data that updates less frequently.

## 5. Create Parsers for Structured Financial Data Formats [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Implement specialized parsers for financial data in various structured formats
### Details:
Develop parsers for CSV, JSON, XML, and XBRL formats commonly used in financial data. Create utilities to handle specialized financial data formats from Bloomberg, Reuters, and other providers. Implement validation logic to ensure data integrity and completeness. Add support for handling large datasets efficiently with streaming parsers. Create adapters to convert between different format representations.

## 6. Implement Data Normalization and Integration Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5
### Description: Create a system to normalize and standardize financial data from different sources
### Details:
Develop a normalization framework to convert data from different sources into a consistent format for the TradeWizard platform. Implement entity resolution to match identical financial instruments across different providers. Create data quality checks and anomaly detection. Build a caching layer for optimized data retrieval. Implement an API that provides unified access to all financial data regardless of source. Add comprehensive logging for data lineage tracking.
