# Task ID: 6
# Title: Develop News and Analysis Content Extraction
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build specialized scrapers for financial news, analysis articles, and research reports.
# Details:
Implement scrapers for major financial news sources, blogs, and research platforms. Extract article content, publication date, author information, and categorization. Develop text processing functions to clean HTML, extract key information, and identify relevant financial entities mentioned in the content. Create a system to assess the credibility and relevance of news sources.

# Test Strategy:
Test news extraction against various financial news sites. Verify full article content is captured correctly with proper attribution and metadata. Check that text processing functions correctly identify financial entities (companies, currencies, etc.) mentioned in articles.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Source Mapping and Configuration System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a flexible configuration system to define news sources, their structure, and extraction parameters
### Details:
Develop a YAML/JSON-based configuration system that defines: (1) URLs and access methods for each news source, (2) HTML/DOM selectors for content, publication date, author, and category elements, (3) Source metadata including credibility indicators and topic focus. Include configuration for major financial news sites (Bloomberg, Reuters, WSJ, etc.), financial blogs, and research platforms. Design the system to be easily extensible for new sources.

## 2. Implement Core Scraper Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Build the base scraper engine that handles network requests, rate limiting, and HTML retrieval
### Details:
Develop a modular scraper framework using Python with libraries like Requests, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium where needed. Implement: (1) Asynchronous request handling for efficient scraping, (2) Robust error handling and retry logic, (3) Rate limiting and request throttling to avoid IP blocks, (4) User-agent rotation and proxy support, (5) Session management for sources requiring authentication. The framework should load source configurations from subtask 1 and provide a unified interface for content extraction.

## 3. Develop Content Extraction and Cleaning Functions [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Create specialized functions to extract and clean article content from different source types
### Details:
Build text processing functions that: (1) Extract main article content while removing ads, navigation, and irrelevant elements, (2) Clean HTML and normalize text formatting, (3) Extract structured metadata (publication date, author, categories) and normalize formats, (4) Handle different article types (news, analysis, research reports) with appropriate extraction logic, (5) Implement fallback extraction methods for cases where primary selectors fail. Test extraction quality across different sources and article types.

## 4. Implement Entity Recognition and Financial Context Analysis [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Add NLP capabilities to identify financial entities and extract key information from article content
### Details:
Integrate NLP processing to: (1) Identify companies, financial instruments, markets, and economic indicators mentioned in articles, (2) Extract key financial metrics and figures, (3) Detect sentiment and tone related to financial entities, (4) Recognize relationships between entities (e.g., acquisitions, partnerships), (5) Tag content with relevant financial categories and topics. Use spaCy or similar NLP libraries with custom financial entity recognition models or rules.

## 5. Build Source Credibility Assessment System [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.3, 6.4
### Description: Develop a system to evaluate and score the credibility and relevance of news sources
### Details:
Create a multi-factor credibility assessment system that: (1) Tracks source reputation based on predefined criteria and historical accuracy, (2) Implements fact-checking against known financial data where possible, (3) Detects potential bias or promotional content, (4) Evaluates depth of analysis and supporting evidence in content, (5) Assigns confidence scores to extracted information based on source credibility and content analysis. The system should maintain credibility profiles for sources and provide confidence metrics for extracted information.
