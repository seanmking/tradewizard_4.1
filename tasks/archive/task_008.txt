# Task ID: 8
# Title: Create Data Integration and Enrichment Pipeline
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Build a pipeline that integrates data from multiple sources and enriches it with additional context and relationships.
# Details:
Develop a data integration pipeline that combines information from web scraping, social media, and financial data sources. Implement entity resolution to link mentions of the same company or financial instrument across different sources. Create enrichment processes that add context, historical data, and relationship information. Build a system to detect conflicts or inconsistencies in data from different sources.

# Test Strategy:
Test the integration pipeline with sample data from multiple sources. Verify that entity resolution correctly identifies the same entities across different formats and naming conventions. Check that enrichment processes add valuable context without introducing errors.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Data Source Connectors [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create modular connectors for each data source (web scraping, social media, financial data) with standardized output formats
### Details:
Implement adapter patterns for each data source type. Each connector should handle authentication, rate limiting, and transform source-specific data into a common JSON schema. Include error handling and logging. For web scraping, build in proxy rotation and respect robots.txt. For social media, implement OAuth flows. For financial data, ensure secure API key management.

## 2. Implement Data Extraction and Normalization Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Build a system to extract structured data from sources and normalize formats, dates, currencies, and measurements
### Details:
Create parsers for different data formats (JSON, XML, HTML, CSV). Implement normalization functions for dates (to ISO 8601), currencies (to a base currency with conversion rates), company names (canonical forms), and numerical values (consistent units). Use NLP techniques for extracting entities from unstructured text. Store both raw and normalized data for auditability.

## 3. Develop Entity Resolution System [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Create a system to identify and link mentions of the same entities (companies, people, financial instruments) across different data sources
### Details:
Implement fuzzy matching algorithms (e.g., Levenshtein distance, Jaccard similarity) for name matching. Use machine learning for entity classification and matching. Create a knowledge graph to store entity relationships. Implement a confidence scoring system for matches. Build a manual review interface for low-confidence matches. Design a persistent entity registry with unique identifiers.

## 4. Build Data Enrichment Processors [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Create processors that augment base data with additional context, historical information, and derived metrics
### Details:
Implement time-series analysis for historical context. Create relationship extractors to identify connections between entities. Add industry classification and hierarchical categorization. Calculate derived financial metrics (P/E ratios, growth rates, etc.). Implement sentiment analysis for text data. Design the enrichment as pluggable modules that can be configured per use case.

## 5. Implement Conflict Detection and Resolution [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3, 8.4
### Description: Build a system to identify and resolve conflicts or inconsistencies in data from different sources
### Details:
Create rule-based conflict detection for factual data (e.g., company headquarters, founding date). Implement statistical methods for numerical conflicts (e.g., revenue figures). Design resolution strategies: newest source wins, highest confidence wins, average values, or flag for manual review. Build a conflict audit log. Create visualization tools to highlight conflicts for analysts.

## 6. Create Pipeline Orchestration System [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5
### Description: Develop a system to coordinate the execution of all pipeline components with proper sequencing, error handling, and recovery
### Details:
Implement a DAG-based workflow engine to manage task dependencies. Add monitoring and alerting for pipeline failures. Create retry mechanisms with exponential backoff. Implement checkpointing for long-running processes. Design parallel processing where possible. Build logging throughout the pipeline for debugging and audit purposes. Create a dashboard for pipeline status visualization.

## 7. Implement Data Quality Validation and Output Interfaces [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.6
### Description: Create validation checks for the integrated data and build interfaces for downstream consumption
### Details:
Implement schema validation for output data. Create statistical anomaly detection for data quality issues. Build data completeness checks. Implement API endpoints for data access with proper authentication. Create export capabilities to various formats (JSON, CSV, database). Design subscription mechanisms for real-time updates. Document the output schema and provide example queries for common use cases.
