# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Core Web Scraping Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the foundational web scraping framework that will handle various financial and news websites.
# Details:
Create a modular scraping framework that can handle different types of websites. Implement base scraper classes that can be extended for specific sites. Include functionality for handling pagination, authentication if needed, rate limiting, and proxy rotation. Develop error handling mechanisms and retry logic. Ensure the framework can extract structured data from HTML and convert it to a standardized format.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for the base scraper classes. Test against a sample financial website to verify the framework can navigate pages and extract basic information correctly. Validate error handling by intentionally causing failures.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Base Scraper Class Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational abstract base classes that define the core scraping functionality and interfaces
### Details:
Implement an abstract BaseScraper class that defines the common interface for all scrapers. Include abstract methods for initialization, page fetching, data extraction, and result formatting. Design interfaces for configuration options including request headers, timeouts, and retry settings. Create a ScraperResult class to standardize output format across different scrapers. Document the extension points for site-specific implementations.

## 2. Implement HTTP Request Management System [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Develop the HTTP request handling layer with support for different request methods, headers, and session management
### Details:
Build a RequestManager class that handles HTTP requests with configurable timeout, headers, and cookies. Implement session persistence for websites requiring login state. Add support for different HTTP methods (GET, POST). Create utility functions for handling common content types (HTML, JSON, XML). Implement request throttling to prevent overloading target servers. Include methods to handle and parse responses, with appropriate error handling for different HTTP status codes.

## 3. Develop Rate Limiting and Proxy Rotation [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Create systems to manage request frequency and rotate between different proxies to avoid IP blocking
### Details:
Implement a RateLimiter class that enforces configurable delays between requests to the same domain. Create a ProxyManager that maintains a pool of proxy servers and rotates between them. Add functionality to detect when a proxy has been blocked or is performing poorly. Implement backoff strategies for when rate limits are encountered. Create a configuration system to specify different rate limiting rules for different target websites. Include logging of proxy usage and performance metrics.

## 4. Build HTML Parsing and Data Extraction System [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Implement the core data extraction functionality to parse HTML and extract structured data
### Details:
Create a DataExtractor class with methods for common extraction patterns using CSS selectors, XPath, and regex. Implement specialized extractors for common data types (tables, lists, nested elements). Add methods to clean and normalize extracted text (removing extra whitespace, normalizing Unicode, etc.). Create utilities for converting between data formats (HTML tables to CSV/JSON). Implement validation methods to ensure extracted data meets expected formats. Include debugging tools to help identify when selectors fail to match.

## 5. Implement Pagination and Navigation Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.4
### Description: Develop functionality to handle multi-page content and navigate through website structures
### Details:
Create a PaginationHandler class that can detect and navigate through different pagination styles (numbered pages, 'load more' buttons, infinite scroll). Implement methods to extract and follow navigation links within a website. Add support for depth and breadth limits when crawling linked pages. Create utilities to track already visited URLs to avoid loops. Implement smart waiting between page loads based on page rendering requirements. Add support for handling JavaScript-rendered pagination through integration with headless browsers if needed.

## 6. Develop Error Handling and Retry Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.3, 2.5
### Description: Implement comprehensive error handling, logging, and retry mechanisms
### Details:
Create an ErrorHandler class with specialized handling for common scraping errors (network issues, parsing failures, blocked requests). Implement configurable retry logic with exponential backoff for transient errors. Add extensive logging throughout the framework with different verbosity levels. Create a system to pause and resume scraping jobs that encounter persistent errors. Implement circuit breaker patterns to prevent repeated failures. Add functionality to save the state of a scraping job to allow manual intervention and resumption.
