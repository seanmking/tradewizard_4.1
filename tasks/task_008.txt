# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Complete User Flows and Navigation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Connect all components into cohesive user flows and implement the left navigation panel for progress tracking and section navigation.
# Details:
Develop the Left Navigation Panel with assessment progress tracking, section navigation, resource links, and completion status indicators. Implement state persistence using local storage. Create exit points for each flow as specified in the PRD (save and continue later, download options, sharing features). Connect all assessment components into cohesive flows matching the specifications. Implement navigation between all assessment stages.

# Test Strategy:
Test complete user journeys through all assessment stages. Verify progress tracking functionality. Test state persistence when leaving and returning to the application. Validate all exit points and continuation paths. Test navigation between different sections of the assessment.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Left Navigation Panel [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the left navigation panel component with section links and progress tracking functionality
### Details:
Build a reusable navigation panel component that displays all assessment sections. Include visual indicators for completed sections, current section, and locked sections. Design should follow the PRD specifications and match the overall UI. Include placeholder elements for progress tracking that will be connected to state in subtask 2.

## 2. Implement State Management and Persistence [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Create a state management system for tracking user progress across assessment flows with local storage persistence
### Details:
Develop a state management solution that tracks user progress through all assessment sections. Implement local storage persistence to save progress automatically. Create functions to update progress state when sections are completed. Connect the state to the navigation panel developed in subtask 1 to reflect accurate progress. Include logic for section unlocking based on completion status of prerequisites.

## 3. Implement Exit Points and Flow Controls [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Add exit points and flow control mechanisms throughout the assessment process
### Details:
Implement 'Save and continue later' functionality that leverages the persistence system from subtask 2. Create download options for assessment results and reports. Develop sharing features as specified in the PRD. Add confirmation dialogs for critical actions like exiting without saving. Ensure all exit points maintain proper state and return users to the correct location when they resume.

## 4. Connect Components into Cohesive User Flows [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3
### Description: Integrate all assessment components into complete user flows with proper navigation between stages
### Details:
Connect all previously developed components into complete, cohesive flows according to the PRD specifications. Implement navigation between all assessment stages, ensuring that state is properly maintained throughout the entire process. Test complete user journeys from start to finish, including edge cases like returning to a saved assessment. Ensure that the navigation panel accurately reflects the user's position in the flow and allows jumping between unlocked sections. Finalize the integration of progress tracking with all components.
