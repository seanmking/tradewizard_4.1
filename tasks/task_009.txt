# Task ID: 9
# Title: Develop Context Panel with Supporting Information
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the right context panel to display context-specific information, detailed forms, visualizations, and supporting documentation.
# Details:
Create the Right Context Panel with dynamic content based on the current assessment stage. Implement detailed forms for complex inputs. Develop visualizations for data representation. Add supporting documentation sections. Include relevant statistics and insights. Ensure the panel is responsive and properly integrates with the conversation flow in the center panel.

# Test Strategy:
Verify context-appropriate content appears at each assessment stage. Test detailed forms for data capture and validation. Validate visualizations with different data sets. Test responsive behavior of the context panel on various screen sizes.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement the base Context Panel component structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational UI component for the right context panel with responsive layout and integration points with the center conversation panel
### Details:
Build a React component for the right context panel with responsive design (adapting to different screen sizes). Implement the panel container with proper styling, scrolling behavior, and state management. Create the connection points to receive the current assessment stage from the main application state. Define the component API that will allow dynamic content loading. Include basic show/hide functionality and smooth transitions when the panel content changes.

## 2. Develop stage-specific content components and state management [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create the system to dynamically load different content based on the current assessment stage
### Details:
Implement a content router that displays different components based on the current assessment stage. Create placeholder components for each assessment stage type. Develop the state management system to track the current stage and update the panel accordingly. Build the communication layer between the center conversation panel and the context panel to ensure context changes are reflected immediately. Include loading states and error handling for content transitions.

## 3. Implement detailed form components and data visualizations [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Create the interactive form components for complex inputs and data visualization components for insights
### Details:
Develop reusable form components for complex data input (multi-step forms, conditional fields, validation). Implement data visualization components using a charting library (like D3.js, Chart.js or similar) to display statistics and insights. Create components for different visualization types (bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, etc.) that can be configured based on the data. Ensure all components are accessible and responsive. Add animations for data transitions and implement proper data loading states.

## 4. Add supporting documentation and finalize integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Implement the supporting documentation sections and complete the integration with the conversation flow
### Details:
Create components to display supporting documentation with proper formatting (markdown support, code snippets, etc.). Implement a system to load relevant documentation based on the current context. Add functionality to expand/collapse documentation sections for better space management. Finalize the integration with the conversation flow, ensuring the context panel updates appropriately as the conversation progresses. Add user preference settings for the panel (width, visibility defaults). Perform thorough testing of the entire context panel across different assessment stages and conversation flows.
