## Task-Driven Implementation Policy

1. **Authoritative Task Source**
   - All implementation, progress tracking, and reporting must be aligned to the current `task-master` task and subtask structure in `/tasks`.

2. **Subtask Completion Criteria**
   - No subtask may be marked as done until it fully meets PRD, technical, and UX requirements and is verified in code and/or UI.
   - All deliverables must be reviewed against subtask acceptance criteria.

3. **Progress Reporting**
   - All progress updates, blockers, and next steps must reference the relevant task/subtask IDs.

4. **Feature, Bugfix, and Refactor Policy**
   - All new features, bugfixes, and refactors must reference a specific task or subtask ID from `task-master`.

5. **Automation**
   - When a subtask is completed, it must be marked as done in `task-master` using the appropriate CLI command to ensure dashboard accuracy.

6. **Continuous Alignment**
   - If the subtask structure changes, implementation and reporting must be realigned accordingly.
